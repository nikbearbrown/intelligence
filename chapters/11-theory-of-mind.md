# Chapter 11 — Theory of Mind
*The ape looked at the wrong place. She knew the right place. She looked at the wrong one because the actor was going to the wrong one — and she knew that too.*

---

In a primate research center in Japan, a chimpanzee is sitting in a quiet room. An infrared eye-tracker is watching her eyes. On the screen in front of her, a video is playing.

The video shows a person searching for an object. A few minutes ago — in the video — the person watched the object get hidden in a particular spot. Then the person left the room. While the person was gone, someone moved the object to a different location.

The person is now returning. In a few moments, they will begin to search.

A fraction of a second before the person starts to move, the chimpanzee's eyes shift. They move to a location on the screen.

They move to the place where the object *used to be*. The place where the actor falsely believes it still is. Not the place where it now sits. The place the actor *thinks* it is.

The chimpanzee is anticipating a mistake. She is predicting that the actor will go to the wrong place, based on a belief she knows to be false — and she is doing this before the actor has made any movement she could simply follow.

Christopher Krupenye and colleagues published this result in *Science* in 2016. It was the first time any non-human animal had passed a version of the false-belief task — the test that, since 1983, had served as the gold standard for theory of mind. Forty years of prior experiments had found that great apes could not do this. Eye-tracking showed they could.

The ape looked at the wrong place. The wrong place was the right answer.

---

To understand why this matters, I need to explain the problem it was trying to solve, because the problem is harder than it looks.

The concept of theory of mind entered comparative cognition in 1978, in a paper by David Premack and Guy Woodruff. Their subject was a chimpanzee named Sarah, trained to communicate with plastic symbols. They showed her short films of a person trying to solve problems — reaching for bananas suspended too high, trying to operate a disconnected heater — and gave her photographs showing various solutions. She consistently chose the correct solution photograph. They inferred that Sarah understood the actor's *purpose*.

The philosopher Daniel Dennett read the paper and immediately identified the problem. Sarah might not be attributing anything to the actor at all. She might simply be solving the physical problem in her own head and selecting the correct photograph — with no reference to what the actor believes or wants. To rule this out, Dennett argued, you need a design in which the subject's knowledge of the world *differs* from the actor's knowledge, and the test is whether the subject predicts the actor's behavior based on the actor's false belief rather than on the truth.

Heinz Wimmer and Josef Perner provided the design in 1983. Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith made it canonical in 1985 with the Sally-Anne paradigm.

Sally puts a marble in a basket. Sally leaves the room. Anne moves the marble to a box. Sally returns.

Where will Sally look for her marble?

<!-- → [DIAGRAM: The Sally-Anne false-belief task — three-panel sequence: (1) Sally hides marble in basket, both Sally and Anne present; (2) Sally leaves, Anne moves marble to box; (3) Sally returns, question mark over her head — arrow pointing to basket (correct answer: false-belief location) and arrow pointing to box (wrong answer: actual location) — reader should see that the correct answer requires representing Sally's outdated belief, not the true state of the world] -->

Four-year-old neurotypical children answer correctly: the basket, where Sally left it and where Sally *believes* it still is. Three-year-olds answer incorrectly: the box, where the marble actually is. The three-year-old's error is not a memory failure. Ask where the marble is and the three-year-old knows. Ask where Sally will look and the three-year-old says the box — their own accurate knowledge of the marble's location overrides the inference about Sally's belief.

What changes between age three and age four is the capacity to hold a representation of a belief *as a representation* — as a mental state that exists in a mind and that can be wrong about the world. The three-year-old represents the world as it is. The four-year-old can also represent how someone else represents the world, even when that representation is false.

For forty years after Sally-Anne was established, great apes failed every version of it. Across multiple laboratories, multiple species, multiple experimental variations, the apes behaved like three-year-olds. The consensus hardened: great apes could attribute goals and perhaps desires, but not beliefs. They were perspective-takers but not false-belief reasoners.

Krupenye's result broke the consensus. It is worth being precise about how.

---

The difference between 2016 and the previous forty years is not the species. It is the measure.

All previous false-belief tests with non-human animals used behavioral responses: select a photograph, press a button, search in a location. These *explicit* measures require active, controlled, deliberate response. In humans, the explicit false-belief task recruits substantial executive function — particularly the ability to suppress your own accurate knowledge about where the marble is in order to compute what Sally believes. Human children show the anticipatory-looking pattern in *implicit* false-belief tasks — where no response is required and the eye-tracker simply records where attention goes — as early as fifteen months, more than two years before they can pass the explicit version.

What Krupenye found, across chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans, was that the anticipatory gaze went to the false-belief location before the actor began to search. The gaze shift happened before any movement occurred that the ape could simply track or imitate. Something in the visual anticipation system was generating a prediction based on the actor's mental state.

The critic's response was immediate. Cecilia Heyes, the Oxford comparative psychologist who has spent decades pushing back on mentalistic interpretations, argued that the apes could be running *submentalizing* — simple learned rules about where objects last appeared in an actor's view, with no representation of belief as a mental state. The apes had extensive experience watching objects get moved; they might have learned a statistical regularity that actors tend to look where they last interacted with an object.

Fumihiro Kano and colleagues answered this directly in their 2019 follow-up in *PNAS*. They pre-exposed different apes to barriers of the type used in the main experiment — opaque for some apes, transparent for others. Later, all apes watched a video in which an actor stood behind a barrier of the same type they had experienced. The apes' anticipatory gaze depended on their *own past experience* with that specific barrier type. Apes who had experienced the barrier as opaque expected the actor to be ignorant of what was on the other side. Apes who had experienced it as transparent expected the actor to have seen through it.

<!-- → [TABLE: Kano 2019 barrier-experience design — columns: pre-exposure condition, what the ape learned about this barrier type, predicted anticipatory gaze under submentalizing account, predicted anticipatory gaze under perspective-projection account, observed result; rows: opaque-barrier group, transparent-barrier group — reader should see that the two accounts make the same prediction for the opaque group and opposite predictions for the transparent group, and that the result distinguishes them] -->

This is not a statistical regularity about objects in actors' views. The apes were *projecting their own perceptual experience* onto the actor — using their knowledge of what that type of barrier permits or blocks to infer what the actor had been able to see. The actor's belief depends on what the actor was able to perceive, and the ape knows something about what that barrier allows one to perceive. This is the core operation of visual perspective-taking elevated to false-belief computation.

The floor of theory of mind has moved. The apes are not doing Sally-Anne explicitly. They are doing something structurally equivalent to it, implicitly, in a prediction system that runs before any deliberate response is made.

---

Now let me tell you what theory of mind is actually computing, because a computational frame makes the comparative evidence much clearer.

In ordinary reinforcement learning — the subject of Chapter 8 — an agent is given a reward function and learns a policy that maximizes it. In *inverse reinforcement learning*, the situation reverses. An observer watches another agent behave and infers the reward function that explains the behavior. Pieter Abbeel and Andrew Ng introduced this as a technique for robot learning from human demonstration; the cognitive science literature has been converging on the view that it is a general description of what theory-of-mind systems do.

When you watch someone walk toward the kitchen, you do not just represent their trajectory. You infer that they are hungry (the reward function) and believe food is in the kitchen (the world model). From observed behavior, you back-compute a compact set of latent variables — desires, beliefs, intentions — that explains everything the person is doing and that will, if accurate, predict what they do next in situations you have not yet observed.

This compression is what makes theory of mind useful. Without it, social prediction requires memorizing every behavior sequence every individual has ever produced in every context. With it, a small number of attributed mental states generalize to predictions about infinitely many novel situations. The attributed reward function is the compact model; observed behavior is the data the model is fitted to.

<!-- → [DIAGRAM: Inverse reinforcement learning as theory of mind — left side: observed behavior sequence (person walks toward kitchen, opens refrigerator, scans interior); right side: inferred latent variables (desire: food; belief: food is here; intention: eat); arrow from observed behavior to inferred variables labeled "IRL inference"; arrow from inferred variables to predicted future behavior labeled "generalization to novel situations" — reader should see that the compact mental-state representation is what allows generalization beyond the observed cases] -->

Applied to the hierarchy of capacities in this chapter: goal attribution is inverse reinforcement learning that infers only the target state of the agent's policy. Perspective-taking adds the agent's information state — what it can see. False-belief reasoning adds the possibility that the agent's world model is *wrong*, and uses the agent's false model rather than the true world to predict behavior. Each level requires the observer to hold a richer internal representation of the target agent's mind.

The great ape result is compelling for what it shows in a lineage close to our own. The corvid result is compelling for a different reason: it shows the same functional capacity appearing in a brain built on entirely different principles, in a lineage separated from humans by more than 300 million years.

Western scrub jays store food in hundreds of small caches distributed across their territory. They are prodigious thieves — they routinely raid each other's caches, and dominant birds displace subordinates from discovered food. Knowing who has seen what about where food is cached is survival-relevant information.

Nathan Emery and Nicola Clayton, in their 2001 *Nature* paper, gave a jay the opportunity to cache food while another jay watched from a nearby cage. In other trials, the caching jay worked alone. Subsequently, the caching jay was given private access to all the cache sites and could move items freely.

Jays that had been observed during caching moved their caches to new locations. Jays that had cached unobserved did not. The caching jay was responding to whether it had been *seen* — perspective-taking. But the theory-of-mind claim rests on the next observation: the protective re-caching occurred specifically in jays that had themselves been thieves in the past. Naive jays, who had never stolen another bird's cache, did not re-cache even when observed. Only experienced thieves took the protective measure.

The mechanism Emery and Clayton proposed is self-projection: the experienced thief knows what it does when it watches another bird cache — it steals — and it projects this behavioral tendency onto the watching observer. The computation is: *this bird is in the same perceptual position I have been in when I have stolen from others; I know what I do in that position; therefore I know what this bird is likely to do*.

This is not the Sally-Anne false-belief task. It does not require representing a false belief. But it requires something Sally-Anne does not explicitly demand: taking one's own mental states as a *model* for another agent's mental states. The jay is using itself as a theory-of-mind engine, running its own behavioral propensities forward through the lens of the other bird's perspective. It takes a thief, literally and specifically, to know what a thief will do.

Corvids lack a six-layered neocortex. Their executive control runs through the nidopallium caudolaterale — anatomically distinct from mammalian prefrontal cortex, functionally analogous. The same conclusion as Chapter 9 and Chapter 10: the computation is the constraint. The substrate is not.

The dog case is this chapter's most instructive contrast, because it demonstrates how two very different cognitive operations can produce the same surface behavior.

Dog owners reliably report that their dogs produce a "guilty look" when caught having done something forbidden: cowering, flattened ears, averted gaze, tail tucked. The owner interprets this as the dog *knowing it did wrong* — evidence that the dog is attributing to the owner a belief about misbehavior and producing a conciliatory response based on that belief.

Alexandra Horowitz ran the experiment. Owners left their dogs alone with a forbidden treat and returned. Before they returned, Horowitz either told them the truth (the dog had eaten the treat, or had not) or *lied* (the dog had eaten the treat but the owner was told it had not; or the dog had not eaten the treat but the owner was told it had). Owners who were falsely told their dog had misbehaved sometimes scolded the dog before looking at the treat.

The guilty look was not associated with whether the dog had actually eaten the treat. It was associated with whether the owner was scolding. Dogs that had been obedient but were scolded showed as much guilty-look behavior as dogs that had actually misbehaved. Dogs that had misbehaved but whose owners were told they had been obedient showed no guilty look.

<!-- → [TABLE: Horowitz guilty-look experiment — 2×2 design: rows: dog actually misbehaved vs. dog was obedient; columns: owner told misbehaved (scolded) vs. owner told obedient (not scolded); cells: rate of guilty-look behavior — reader should see that guilty-look frequency tracks scolding behavior, not actual misbehavior, demonstrating that the behavior is a response to current human cues rather than to the dog's own represented knowledge of wrongdoing] -->

What the dog is doing is behavioral pattern recognition on current observable cues: when human = angry display, produce = submission signal. The dog has learned, through years of domestication, to read the signals of human displeasure and produce behavior that defuses it. This is sophisticated. It is not theory of mind.

What theory of mind would require: the dog would need to represent that the owner holds the *belief* that the dog misbehaved, and produce the guilty look in response to that represented belief rather than to the observable scolding. To test this, you would need the dog to show guilty-look behavior when the owner holds a false belief about misbehavior but shows *no behavioral cues* of it — in anticipation of discovery, not in response to expression. The current evidence does not support this.

Dogs are extraordinarily good at reading *current human behavior* — better than great apes in many studies of human communicative cuing. They have been domesticated for fifteen thousand years specifically in contexts where reading human intentions from observable cues was fitness-relevant. There is a difference between tracking observable cues and modeling the beliefs that will produce future behavior. The dog has not clearly demonstrated the second.

Now the AI case, which is where the inverse reinforcement learning frame becomes sharpest.

In 2022, Michal Kosinski reported that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 passed a large battery of standard false-belief tasks — Sally-Anne and variants — with accuracy approaching human adults. The result attracted substantial attention, and speculation followed that large language models had developed theory of mind as an emergent property of scale.

Tomer Ullman answered this in 2023 by making small modifications to the same tasks. Replace the opaque container in the Sally-Anne story with a transparent one, so that Sally could have seen the marble move even when she was present. Add a sentence explicitly granting the actor knowledge of the object's new location. Make changes that preserve the *logical structure* of the false-belief situation while altering the *surface features* of the canonical story.

GPT-4, on the modified versions, continued to predict that Sally would look in the basket — the answer correct for the canonical version — even when the modification made it clear that Sally had seen the marble move and therefore knew where it was. The model was applying the learned template: actor-absent-during-move → actor-has-false-belief. It applied this template even when the story's explicit content contradicted it.

Humans do not do this. A human reading the transparent-container version immediately updates the prediction: Sally saw it happen, so Sally knows. The inference generalizes because humans are running an actual model of Sally's information state — a model that takes the story's *content* as input and outputs a belief-state for Sally by applying the IRL computation to that content.

The model is doing something, but it is not doing inverse reinforcement learning on Sally's mental states. It is matching the story to training-distribution templates, and the templates break when the stories are modified in ways that preserve logical structure while altering surface form.

<!-- → [TABLE: Ullman 2023 fragility result — columns: task version, logical structure, surface form matches training distribution, GPT-4 prediction, correct prediction; rows: canonical Sally-Anne (opaque container, actor absent), transparent-container modification (actor present but could see), explicit-knowledge modification (story states actor was told where marble went) — reader should see that GPT-4 answers the canonical version correctly and the modifications incorrectly, and that the pattern matches template-matching rather than content-based inference] -->

By the IRL frame, this is the diagnostic. A system genuinely doing theory of mind should pass Ullman's modifications, because it is computing Sally's information state from the story's content rather than from the story's surface resemblance to training examples. A system pattern-matching on narrative templates should fail the modifications while passing the canonical versions — because the template and the logic only coincide within the canonical form, and the modification is precisely designed to pull them apart.

The 2023 models failed the modifications. This is the chapter's strongest evidence that what LLMs do when they appear to pass theory-of-mind tasks is not the same operation that a great ape performs when it anticipates an actor's false belief. One is building a model of another mind. The other is matching a template.

---

Let me be direct about what the chapter has established and what it has not.

The implicit false-belief result in great apes — the Krupenye 2016 anticipatory looking, the Kano 2019 barrier-experience control — is replicable and survives the strongest submentalizing alternative tested so far. Self-projective perspective attribution in corvids — the Emery-Clayton re-caching and its theft-experience dependency — is supported and points to a different implementation of the same function. Both species are doing something that satisfies the logical requirements of false-belief reasoning, using mechanisms not simply explained by associative learning on behavioral regularities.

What is not established: second-order recursive false-belief reasoning in any non-human animal. The line between humans and non-human animals in theory of mind now sits at *explicit, second-order, recursive* mentalizing — not at any form of mental-state attribution per se. The corvid result is self-projective, not explicitly recursive. The great ape results are at the first-order level and implicit.

This boundary matters. By the operational definition of intelligence — the ability to achieve goals across a wide range of environments — theory of mind is valuable across a wide range of its levels. A social environment is navigable with perspective-taking alone. It is navigable better with first-order false-belief attribution. It is navigable best with the recursive structure that allows strategic deception, coalition-building, political maneuvering, and the transmission of cultural knowledge through deliberate teaching. The richer levels produce a qualitatively different range of achievable goals, not just better performance on the same ones.

The ape who looked at the wrong place has something real. The four-year-old who said "the basket" has something more of the same kind. What exactly the "more" consists of, and how much of it is specifically enabled by language, is the question Chapter 15 approaches.

---

Here is what I want you to carry out of this chapter.

Theory of mind is inverse reinforcement learning — the brain's algorithm for inferring the reward function and world model of another agent from observed behavior, producing a compact internal representation that generalizes across novel situations. A system genuinely doing this generalizes when the scenario is modified. A system pattern-matching on narrative templates does not. The Ullman result is the clean test, and it separates the two.

The common mistake is treating behavioral evidence for perspective-taking as evidence for false-belief reasoning. The subordinate chimpanzee taking food the dominant cannot see is doing perspective-taking. The chimpanzee anticipating that an actor will search in the wrong place is doing false-belief reasoning. The behaviors can look similar from outside. The cognitive operations are distinct, and the experimental designs that test them are different.

And the dog's guilty look is not guilt. It is submission in response to observable scolding cues. Knowing the difference — between tracking observable behavior and modeling the beliefs that will produce future behavior — is the whole content of the implicit/explicit distinction that runs through this chapter.

The ape looked at the wrong place. That gaze carries a great deal of cognition. Forty years of experiments failed to find it not because they were looking in the wrong direction, but because they were looking with the wrong instrument.

## Exercises

### Warm-Up

**1.** A vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call when it spots a hawk, causing others to run into bushes. A different call for ground predators causes them to climb trees. Does this behavior require theory of mind? If not, what does it require? Specify what additional observation — one specific result — would establish that the calling monkey is attributing knowledge or fear to its audience rather than simply producing a context-specific vocalization conditioned on threat type.
*(Tests the distinction between goal attribution and perspective-taking; difficulty: accessible)*

**2.** The Sally-Anne task is modified: Sally stays in the room but is clearly distracted by her phone and not paying attention when Anne moves the marble. Where will Sally look? Explain how a genuine theory-of-mind system would approach this modification using the IRL frame. What would a three-year-old predict, and why? What would a template-matching system predict on the canonical versus the distracted-Sally version?
*(Tests application of the IRL frame and the false-belief task logic to a novel variant; difficulty: accessible)*

**3.** In the Emery-Clayton re-caching result, only jays with past theft experience showed protective re-caching when observed. A skeptic argues this could be explained without self-projection: experienced thieves have simply learned that being-observed is a reliable cue for subsequent cache loss, without any mental-state attribution. Design one experiment — specifying the manipulation and the prediction — that would distinguish the self-projection account from the learned-cue account.
*(Tests whether the student can operationalize the difference between associative learning and mental-state modeling; difficulty: accessible)*

### Application

**4.** The Horowitz guilty-look experiment used a 2×2 design crossing whether the dog actually misbehaved with whether the owner was told it had. The result: guilty-look frequency tracked scolding behavior, not actual misbehavior. A dog-training company argues: "This just shows dogs are good at reading humans — it doesn't mean they lack theory of mind, because they may be modeling the owner's belief through behavioral cues rather than directly." Evaluate this argument. What would the dog need to do to demonstrate that it is modeling beliefs through cues rather than simply responding to cues?
*(Tests understanding of the observable-cue vs. belief-modeling distinction; difficulty: moderate)*

**5.** You are evaluating an AI assistant for a social companion application. The assistant is given transcripts of previous conversations with a user and asked to predict what the user will want in a new situation. It performs well on situations similar to past transcripts and fails on situations that are logically equivalent but phrased differently. Using the Ullman result and the IRL frame, explain what this performance pattern tells you about the mechanism the assistant is using. What would the assistant need to demonstrate to establish genuine user-model inference?
*(Tests application of the template-matching vs. genuine-IRL distinction to an AI deployment scenario; difficulty: moderate)*

**6.** The implicit/explicit distinction in false-belief reasoning means great apes pass the implicit version but fail the explicit version. Human children pass the implicit version at fifteen months and the explicit version at four years. What cognitive capacity is required for the explicit version that the implicit version does not require? And why might that capacity specifically be what fails in great apes rather than the underlying false-belief computation itself?
*(Tests understanding of what executive function adds to the implicit capacity and why the implicit/explicit gap is informative; difficulty: moderate)*

### Synthesis

**7.** Chapter 9 described how the hippocampal-cortical system simulates future trajectories before acting. Theory of mind requires modeling another agent's trajectory given that agent's beliefs and desires rather than one's own. What would the simulation machinery of Chapter 9 need to do differently to serve theory of mind rather than self-directed planning? Specifically: what additional inputs would it require, what would it need to hold constant (the other agent's beliefs rather than one's own), and what would constitute evidence that the same hippocampal machinery is being repurposed for social simulation rather than a separate system being invoked?
*(Requires connecting the simulation architecture of Chapter 9 to the IRL computation described here; difficulty: challenging)*

**8.** The chapter argues that LLMs doing template-matching on canonical Sally-Anne stories and great apes doing implicit anticipatory gazing are performing different cognitive operations, even when both produce the right answer on the canonical task. A skeptic responds: "The ape's anticipatory gaze is also a learned association — it has watched many videos, it has learned that absent actors search at last-known locations. How is this different in kind from the LLM's template?" Use the Kano 2019 barrier-experience result to make the distinction precise. What does the barrier result show that a simple learned-association account cannot explain?
*(Synthesizes the Kano follow-up with the IRL frame and the LLM comparison; difficulty: challenging)*

### Challenge

**9.** The chapter notes that the line between human and non-human theory of mind now sits at explicit, second-order, recursive mentalizing — and suggests this capacity may depend critically on language. Develop the strongest version of this claim: what specifically does language provide that would enable second-order recursion? Then develop the strongest objection: is there evidence that second-order mentalizing appears in prelinguistic human infants, or in deaf individuals raised without sign language, that would suggest the capacity is not language-dependent? What experiment — in either developmental psychology or comparative cognition — would most cleanly distinguish the language-dependent from the language-independent account?
*(Open-ended; requires engaging with the language-cognition boundary and its bearing on the comparative hierarchy; difficulty: advanced)*
