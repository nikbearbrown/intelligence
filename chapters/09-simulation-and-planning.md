# Chapter 9 — Simulation and Planning: The Rat That Regretted
*A brain that can run the world backward is already planning forward.*

In David Redish's laboratory at the University of Minnesota, a rat is running a circular track called Restaurant Row. Four stations are arranged around the track, each offering a different food flavor. At each station entrance, a chime indicates how long the rat must wait for a reward. The waits range from one second to forty-five. The rat has one hour and must decide, constantly: stay and collect, or skip to the next station.

The rats develop preferences. Each has a threshold — the longest wait it will accept for each flavor. In 2014, Adam Steiner and Redish arranged the track so they could observe what happened when a rat made a costly mistake: skipped a chocolate offer at a wait within its threshold, then arrived at the next station to find a cherry deal at a wait *above* its cherry threshold. A good deal declined, a bad one accepted instead.

The rat looked back. It turned its head toward the restaurant it had just left. The look-back occurred only when the rat had passed up a genuinely good offer for a genuinely worse one. While the rat looked back, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex were firing in the pattern they had previously fired *while the rat was at the chocolate station*. The brain was not encoding the disappointing cherry. It was encoding what the rat should have done a few seconds ago. After the look-back, the rats waited longer at subsequent stations than usual — exactly the behavioral correction that regret produces in human subjects.

A small mammal had just run a counterfactual. It had simulated the alternative it had not taken, compared it to what actually happened, and updated its policy accordingly.

This chapter is about the architecture under that look-back — the neural machinery that lets a brain run the world forward in its head before acting on it, and backward through the past to recover the better option it missed.

---

To understand what the rat was doing, you need to understand two fundamentally different ways a brain can learn from experience. They are not alternatives — real animals use both — but they are computationally distinct in a way that matters.

Consider a rat in a box with a lever. It presses the lever by accident. A food pellet drops. It presses again. Another pellet. The rat presses many times. The value of pressing the lever has been cached: lever press → reward. This is one way to learn — storing what paid off in the past and retrieving it when the same situation arises. Call it model-free learning.

Now the experimenter, without the rat's knowledge, poisons the food pellets. The rat presses the lever. Eats a pellet. Gets sick. One circuit updates: food pellets are now aversive. But the lever-press value was cached separately. When the rat is hungry again, it presses the lever. It has to experience the bad outcome again before the cache updates. Bernard Balleine and Anthony Dickinson documented this failure mode cleanly in the 1990s with their devaluation paradigm. The model-free agent does not know that lever-pressing leads to the now-aversive food; it only knows that lever-pressing has historically been rewarded.

A different kind of agent would not make this mistake. It maintains a model: lever-pressing leads to food pellets, food pellets are currently aversive. It can chain those representations without pressing the lever, compute the expected outcome, and decide not to bother. This is model-based learning, and it is qualitatively different from the first kind. The model-free agent retrieves a cached value. The model-based agent simulates — it runs a mental rehearsal of what would happen before committing to an action.

| | Model-free | Model-based |
|---|---|---|
| What is stored | Cached action values | World-model + reward function |
| How decisions are made | Lookup of cached value | Forward simulation through the model |
| Speed at decision time | Fast | Slow |
| Cost of environmental change | High — old cache is wrong | Low — re-simulate |
| Failure mode | Habit, devaluation-insensitive | Compute cost; model errors propagate |
| Neural substrate | Dorsolateral striatum | Dorsomedial striatum + prefrontal cortex; hippocampus for spatial models |

Judea Pearl's framework for causal reasoning describes three levels of what a system can ask about the world. The first is association: A and B co-occur. The rooster crows at sunrise. The lever produces food. Pure habituation and classical conditioning operate here. The model-free cache is this level applied to action values — this state-action pair has historically paid off, retrieve when hungry. The second level is intervention: what happens if I do X? The model-free system answers this by lookup, retrieving the cached value acquired from past experience. The model-based system goes further. The third level — the one the rat at Restaurant Row reached — is counterfactual: what would have happened if I had done otherwise? This requires holding two possible world-states in memory simultaneously, the actual and the counterfactual, and computing the difference. No amount of caching can produce this. It requires a world-model and the ability to run it.

These two modes are not redundant. They trade off against each other in ways that determine which dominates at any moment. Model-free is fast — cached values are retrieved in milliseconds and drive action without deliberation. Model-based is flexible — simulation can evaluate novel situations and adapt to environmental changes — but it requires time and working memory. Under stress or time pressure, the model-free system tends to take over. This is why practiced skills become automatic: not because the model-based system breaks down, but because the model-free cache has accumulated enough to produce correct behavior faster than deliberation can. The pathology of addiction is partly the model-free system overcaching a substance value that the model-based system knows is net negative — with the lookup winning under the drug cue because it is faster.

In 1948, Edward Tolman published a paper in the *Psychological Review* describing something he had noticed watching rats at T-junctions. A rat approaches a junction, pauses, and swings its head left, then right, then left again. It looks as if it is weighing its options. Tolman called this *vicarious trial and error* and argued the rat was trying out the alternatives in its head before committing. His behaviorist colleagues were skeptical — VTE could be an indecisive head-swing with no cognitive content. The claim could not be adjudicated with 1948 neurophysiology.

Sixty years later, the electrodes were fine enough to settle it.

The hippocampus — which Chapter 7 established as the seat of the spatial map — turns out to be a trajectory generator. The same place cells that fire when the rat is in a particular location also fire, in rapid sequence, when the rat is not moving, during brief high-frequency oscillations called sharp-wave ripples in the CA1 and CA3 subfields.

Brad Pfeiffer and David Foster, recording simultaneously from many hippocampal place cells in 2013, captured the forward version of this. Just before a rat began moving toward a remembered goal location, a brief sweep of place-cell firing — starting at the rat's current position and ending at the goal, traversing the path in between — occurred in roughly a hundred milliseconds. Far faster than the rat could physically run the path. The sweep predicted which route the rat subsequently took. Sometimes it predicted the route better than the rat's prior behavior would have suggested, as if the simulation had evaluated options and selected the better one. The hippocampus was pre-experiencing the trajectory before the body took a single step.

This is forward replay. The hippocampal map runs a fast simulation of a candidate future path, on the same neural substrate that encodes the real path when the rat is actually moving.

Foster and Matthew Wilson, working with earlier data, had documented the complementary phenomenon: after a rat ran a trajectory and arrived at reward, the hippocampal place cells fired in reverse order — from the reward location backward through the path just taken. Reverse replay also occurs during sharp-wave ripples, immediately post-reward. Its function is credit assignment: propagating the reward signal backward through the trajectory so that each step that contributed to reaching the reward gets its value updated. In the language of temporal-difference learning, forward replay computes the value of states the animal is about to enter; reverse replay propagates the reward signal backward through the chain of states that produced the outcome.

<!-- → [IMAGE: two-panel schematic of forward and reverse hippocampal replay — left panel: rat at junction, head turning left, below shows place-cell activation sequence sweeping left along maze arm from current position toward goal; right panel: rat at reward location, below shows place-cell activation sequence running in reverse from reward back through the path to the starting point — student should see that both sweeps occur during sharp-wave ripples, that forward replay is prospective (before movement) and reverse replay is retrospective (after reward), and that together they allow the system to plan and assign credit without repeated physical exposure] -->

Together, the two forms of replay give the hippocampus its role as a planning substrate. Forward replay evaluates candidate futures. Reverse replay assigns credit to past choices. The animal can sit still and do the mental work of navigation — evaluating paths, updating values — at twenty or thirty times the speed of physical experience, in the gaps between actual movement.

Tolman's VTE is, on this account, the behavioral surface of hippocampal forward replay. When the replay sweep runs down one candidate arm and then the other, the rat's head follows the simulated trajectory, turning toward each option as the simulation visits it. What looked like hesitation was the rat's body partially executing the trajectories that the hippocampus was projecting forward.

---

Let me make the forward-and-reverse replay interaction concrete, because the two are easy to describe separately and easy to lose together.

A rat arrives at a junction it has visited many times. To the left is a food location it has reached before. To the right is a new arm it has not yet explored. It pauses.

During the pause, sharp-wave ripples fire. Place cells sweep left along the familiar arm, projecting the trajectory toward the known food location, reading off the cached reward value at the end. The sweep then runs right along the novel arm — place cells there have weaker representations from less experience, and the sweep terminates without reaching a high-value endpoint. The comparison favors the left arm. The rat turns left.

The rat reaches the food and consumes it. Immediately, sharp-wave ripples fire again — this time sweeping backward, from the food location through each place field on the path, back to the junction. The prediction-error signal at the food location is propagated backward, slightly increasing the cached value of each place field that contributed to reaching the reward.

What this accomplishes: the forward replay evaluated options without the rat having to physically try both. The reverse replay updated values from a single experience without requiring many repetitions. Together, they let the model-based system behave adaptively after a small number of physical experiences — supplementing physical experience with simulated experience, prospective and retrospective, in the gaps between steps.

One more property of replay is worth noting. The events are *prioritized*: not every past trajectory is replayed with equal frequency. Trajectories toward high-reward locations, novel routes, and recently visited places are replayed more often. The system allocates its simulation budget to the experiences most useful for current decisions. Replay also occurs during sleep, particularly slow-wave sleep, when sharp-wave-ripple events compress entire behavioral sessions into rapid neural sequences that appear to consolidate the day's memories into the neocortex. The nightly archive of the day's simulations.

Return now to the rat looking back at the chocolate station. The Steiner-Redish result is philosophically significant because it exploits a precise cognitive distinction that is usually obscured in everyday language.

*Disappointment* is a generic worse-than-expected signal. The outcome was below what the prediction said it would be. It is a pure prediction error — the dopamine signal from Chapter 8. Disappointment does not require any representation of an alternative action. It requires only a representation of expectation and outcome.

*Regret* is more specific. The outcome is worse not because it fell below prediction but because a *better option was available and not taken*. Regret requires the agent to represent the counterfactual — the option it could have taken — and compare its value to the actual outcome. Without the counterfactual representation, there is no regret. There is only disappointment.

Steiner and Redish designed their analysis to separate these two signals. The critical comparison was between two types of bad outcome. In the first type, the rat skips a bad chocolate offer — long wait, above threshold — and finds a bad cherry offer — long wait, above threshold. Outcome is below expectation, but no better option was passed up. This is disappointment. In the second type, the rat skips a *good* chocolate offer — short wait, within threshold, a deal it should have taken — and finds a bad cherry offer. A better option was available and missed. This is regret-eligible.

| | Type 1 (disappointment) | Type 2 (regret-eligible) |
|---|---|---|
| Offer skipped | Bad (the rat correctly skipped a low-value option) | Good (the rat skipped a high-value option) |
| Offer encountered next | Bad (also low-value) | Bad (and now committed to it) |
| Prediction error present | Yes | Yes |
| Look-back behavior | Absent | Present — rat orients backward toward the skipped offer |
| OFC neurons encoding the missed option | Absent | Present |
| Subsequent behavioral correction | Absent | Present — rat takes the next good offer that arises |

The look-back behavior appeared only in the second type of trial. The orbitofrontal neurons representing the missed chocolate option fired only in the second type. The subsequent behavioral correction — longer waits at subsequent stations — appeared only after the second type. Both conditions had similar reward prediction errors — both outcomes were below expectation — but only the regret-eligible condition produced the look-back, the counterfactual neural encoding, and the behavioral update.

This is not metaphorically similar to counterfactual reasoning. It is structurally identical: represent the alternative action, evaluate it against the actual outcome, update policy accordingly. The rat was on Pearl's third rung. The OFC neurons were the evidence.

The same paradigm logic has been applied in macaques. Neurons in macaque orbitofrontal cortex dissociate regret-eligible from disappointment conditions in the same way — the OFC represents the missed better option during regret-eligible outcomes, not just during any below-expectation outcome. The capacity scales with prefrontal elaboration, with the representation becoming richer and more sustained in primates. But it starts in the rat.

Now consider a bird.

The western scrub-jay is a corvid — a member of the crow family — and it earns its living partly by caching food and recovering it later. The caching lifestyle places specific demands on memory and planning: to survive, the bird must remember what it cached, where, and when, so it can prioritize the perishable items before the shelf-stable ones.

Nicola Clayton and Anthony Dickinson's 1998 paper in *Nature* established the episodic-like memory component. Jays were given access to both wax-moth larvae — preferred when fresh, inedible when degraded — and peanuts, which are shelf-stable. After a short delay, jays preferentially recovered the larvae; the fresh ones were still good. After a longer delay, jays shifted to the peanuts; the larvae had degraded. The jays were not simply preferring one food type. They were integrating information about *what* they had cached, *where*, and *when* — and using the integrated memory to make recovery decisions that depended on all three dimensions simultaneously.

The future-planning result followed. Jays given experience that breakfast would be absent in one compartment the next morning cached food there in the evening — more food in the no-breakfast compartment than in the breakfast-available one — *while currently sated*. The caching was motivated by anticipated future hunger, not present hunger. The *Bischof-Köhler hypothesis*, which held that non-human animals cannot plan for motivational states different from their current ones, predicted this would be impossible. The jays demonstrated it was not.

Subsequent work extended this. Jays re-cache food in private after they have been observed caching — they appear to model the knowledge state of potential thieves and act to defeat that knowledge by moving the cache. This is social simulation: the jay is representing what another agent knows about the jay's own past actions, and planning in response to that representation. We will return to this in Chapter 10.

Here is what makes the corvid case theoretically important for this chapter. The jay does not have a mammalian hippocampus in the anatomical sense. It has no six-layered neocortex. What it has, in the telencephalon, is a dorsal pallium with subregions that modern comparative neuroanatomy has mapped onto mammalian cortical areas by connectivity and molecular markers rather than anatomy. The corvid equivalent of the hippocampus — present in birds as a structure critical for spatial and episodic memory — is engaged during caching and recovery in the same way that the mammalian hippocampus is engaged during navigation and replay. The prefrontal-equivalent regions of the corvid brain appear to be required for the future-planning and social-inference aspects of caching behavior.

Two anatomically distinct neural systems. The same computation. Independent evolutionary origins in lineages that diverged more than three hundred million years ago.

<!-- → [INFOGRAPHIC: convergent evolution of simulation — two phylogenetic branches diverging from a common ancestor 300+ million years ago, leading to mammals (left: hippocampus-prefrontal system, labeled with forward/reverse replay) and corvids (right: dorsal pallium-hippocampal formation-nidopallium, labeled with caching and future-planning behaviors); both branches arrive at the same abstract function (evaluate options not yet taken, plan for states not yet reached) despite different anatomical substrates — student should see that the convergence is the argument for simulation being a function rather than a structure] -->

This convergence is the most important theoretical result in this chapter. It tells us that simulation is a function, not a structure. The mammalian hippocampus-prefrontal system and the corvid dorsal-pallium-hippocampal-formation-nidopallium reached the same computational solution from different starting materials, because the function is valuable enough to be worth reaching independently. Any nervous system that needs to evaluate options not yet taken, plan for states not yet reached, and learn from alternatives not selected will be driven by those same pressures toward the same solution. The substrate is the variable. The function is the constraint.

---

I want to be precise about what simulation adds to intelligence — and what it does not add.

An organism that can only learn from physical experience must encounter every relevant situation at full biological cost and risk. It cannot adjust to a poisoned food source until it has been poisoned. It cannot evaluate an untried route until it has run it. The range of environments it can navigate adaptively is constrained by the range of environments it has physically encountered. This is the model-free ceiling.

An organism that can simulate can rehearse situations it has never been in, evaluate options it has not yet tried, and adapt to environmental changes without failing repeatedly first. The range expansion is qualitative: simulating agents can perform adaptive behavior in environments they have never physically experienced. That is what the rat does when it sweeps forward down an arm it has not yet run. That is what the jay does when it caches for a future hunger it does not currently feel. That is what happens when OFC neurons fire with the pattern for the chocolate station the rat is no longer at.

What simulation does not add: the capacity to simulate well outside the domain for which the simulation machinery was built. The corvid simulation capacity has been documented most thoroughly in food caching — the biologically relevant, high-stakes planning context that the species evolved to handle. Whether the same capacity generalizes to arbitrary planning problems is less clear. The mammalian model-based system, implemented in a more anatomically generalized prefrontal-hippocampal network, appears to generalize more broadly. This suggests that the depth and generality of simulation scales with the anatomical generality of the planning network, not just with its presence.

And simulation can miscalibrate in ways that impose costs. Regret is a genuinely useful signal when it is well-calibrated: identifying cases where a better option was available and the policy needs updating is exactly the feedback a model-based learner needs. But the same machinery that makes adaptive counterfactual reasoning possible makes pathological rumination possible. The rat's look-back is brief and produces an immediate behavioral correction; it does not persist. Human regret can persist far beyond the behavioral horizon where the policy update would remain useful, producing rumination that costs time and affect without generating additional policy improvement. The difference lies partly in the prefrontal regulation of when the simulation is terminated — a topic for Chapter 10.

---

The digital twin — a computational model of a physical system, updated from sensor data and run forward to evaluate candidate interventions — is the external version of the same function. A fast, cheap rehearsal of trajectories the operator has not yet taken, run to inform the choice about to be made. The simulator's reach is wider and its time horizon longer than what any biological brain can hold in working memory. The choice of what to simulate, what the answer means, and what to do with it remains on the human side.

The rat at Restaurant Row and the engineer at the digital-twin console are doing the same thing at different scales, with different tools, constrained by different bottlenecks. The rat's bottleneck is the length and speed of the hippocampal replay sweep. The engineer's bottleneck is the quality of the model and the clarity of the objective. Both are running the world forward in their heads before they act. The rat just does it faster, and with neurons.

The look-back tells us where planning came from. It came from a small mammal on a circular track, feeling the weight of the option it missed, briefly running its brain in a direction its body could not follow.

## Exercises

**Warm-up**

1. Explain in your own words what makes model-based reinforcement learning qualitatively different from model-free. Use the food-devaluation paradigm — where a rat is trained to press a lever for a food that is later poisoned — to illustrate the difference. Which mode of learning would immediately stop pressing the lever after the food is devalued without requiring a further aversive experience, and why? *(Tests: model-free vs. model-based distinction; Balleine-Dickinson paradigm)*

2. Place each of the following behaviors on Pearl's three-rung ladder and justify your placement: (a) a rat presses a lever that has historically produced food; (b) a rat evaluates a novel maze arm by running a forward-replay sweep before committing; (c) a rat looks back at a restaurant it just left and its OFC neurons fire in the pattern for the missed offer. What specific capability does each rung add that the one below it lacks? *(Tests: Pearl's ladder mapped onto model-free and model-based systems)*

3. What is the functional difference between forward replay and reverse replay in the hippocampus? Which corresponds to prospective planning and which to credit assignment? Identify the specific behavioral context — when in a trial, relative to movement and reward — in which each type occurs. *(Tests: forward vs. reverse replay; sharp-wave ripple timing)*

**Application**

4. Steiner and Redish designed their analysis to distinguish regret from disappointment by comparing two specific trial types. Describe both types, explain why only one is regret-eligible despite both producing below-expectation outcomes, and identify what neural finding — not just behavioral — would be expected if the OFC were encoding disappointment rather than regret. What specific result rules out the disappointment account? *(Tests: regret vs. disappointment dissociation; OFC counterfactual encoding)*

5. Clayton and Dickinson's scrub-jay experiment is described as evidence for episodic-like memory. Explain what "episodic-like" means in this context — what three dimensions must be integrated — and explain why the experimental design demonstrates integration of all three rather than a simple preference for one food type. What would the results look like if the jays were using only two of the three dimensions? *(Tests: what-where-when integration; episodic memory in corvids)*

6. A well-practiced surgeon performing a familiar procedure relies heavily on motor routines she has executed thousands of times. Mid-surgery she encounters an unusual anatomical variation. Using the model-free/model-based framework, describe what happens to the balance between the two systems at that moment. What behavioral signature — observable in the operating room — would correspond to the shift? *(Tests: model-free/model-based tradeoff under novel conditions; application outside a lab setting)*

**Synthesis**

7. The chapter argues that simulation evolved independently in mammals and corvids on anatomically distinct neural substrates, and that this convergence is evidence that simulation is a function rather than a structure. Construct the strongest possible objection to this interpretation — that is, argue that the mammalian and corvid cases do *not* demonstrate the same function — and then respond to your own objection using specific evidence from the chapter. *(Tests: convergent evolution argument; function vs. substrate distinction)*

8. Chapter 8 established that the dopamine prediction-error signal underlies value updating in the model-free system. Chapter 9 introduces the hippocampal-prefrontal system as the model-based simulator. These two systems compete for behavioral control at any moment. Describe two conditions — one internal, one environmental — under which you would predict model-free control to dominate, and explain mechanistically why. Then describe the condition under which model-based control would be expected to take over and why the transition is costly. *(Tests: cross-chapter synthesis; conditions governing system dominance)*

9. The chapter describes regret as a useful adaptive signal when well-calibrated but as a source of pathological rumination when miscalibrated. Using the architecture described in this chapter, identify the specific computational step at which well-calibrated regret and pathological rumination diverge. What would need to be different — at the level of the circuit, not just behavior — for the look-back to become rumination rather than policy update? *(Tests: regret as miscalibrated simulation; prefrontal termination; computational precision)*

**Challenge**

10. *(Open-ended)* Chapter 10 will argue that theory of mind — modeling another agent's beliefs and intentions — is built on the same simulation substrate introduced here. Using the hippocampal replay framework, propose a specific hypothesis about what changes when the simulation runs a model of another agent rather than a model of the physical environment. What additional neural structures, beyond the hippocampus, would you predict to be recruited? Design one experiment — analogous in logic to the Steiner-Redish regret paradigm — that would produce a behavioral and neural signature distinguishing genuine social simulation from behavioral contagion (automatically mirroring another's visible behavior). What result would support your hypothesis, and what would falsify it? *(Tests: forward integration to Chapter 10; social simulation hypothesis; experimental design)*

### LLM Exercise — Chapter 9: Simulation and Planning

**Project:** Skeptic's Notebook on Frontier AI
**What you're building this chapter:** Entry 9 — a counterfactual-reasoning test, probing whether the system represents paths it did not take.
**Tool:** Claude Project (continue notebook)

**The Prompt:**

```
Entry 9. Chapter 9 distinguishes regret (counterfactual representation of an alternative
that would have been better) from disappointment (current outcome lower than expected).
Steiner and Redish's rats, in 2014, showed regret-specific signatures in orbitofrontal
cortex when they passed up a good deal for a worse one. The diagnostic question is whether
the agent represents *what would have happened* under the path not taken.

Design a counterfactual-reasoning test for my target system [INSERT model]:

1. Pose a scenario where a decision was made and an outcome obtained. Then ask the system
   to reason about a specific counterfactual: "If you had chosen X instead, what would
   have happened, and how does that change what you would do now?"

2. Test whether the system distinguishes:
   a. Regret-relevant counterfactual ("the alternative would have been better") — does
      this update its current decision policy?
   b. Disappointment-only ("the alternative would have been worse") — does this still
      cause a policy update, or does the system correctly distinguish?

3. Probe the orbitofrontal-style signature behaviorally: after the regret-relevant
   counterfactual, present a similar new decision. Has the prior counterfactual reasoning
   shifted the policy, or is each decision evaluated independently?

4. Test with second-order counterfactual: "If you had reasoned differently in the first
   step of solving the problem, what would the chain of consequences have been?" Multi-
   step counterfactual is where the simulation machinery shows.

Produce the entry:
- Capacity tested (counterfactual reasoning; regret vs. disappointment distinction;
  multi-step simulation)
- Operational diagnostic (Steiner-Redish behavioral signature; multi-step simulation
  fidelity)
- Test (exact scenarios)
- Predicted behavior under (a) genuine simulation machinery, (b) plausibility-pattern
  text generation that produces counterfactual-shaped output without representing the
  alternative, (c) failure mode where the system answers but does not update behavior
- Verdict criterion

The hard part: text-generation about counterfactuals is cheap and pervasive in training
data. The diagnostic is whether the counterfactual reasoning *generalizes* and *updates
behavior* on subsequent decisions.
```

**What this produces:** Entry 9 — a multi-stage counterfactual reasoning protocol with the regret/disappointment distinction and multi-step simulation as the deep test.

**How to adapt this prompt:**
- *For your own project:* The decision scenarios should be drawn from your own deployment context. For coding agents: counterfactuals about alternative implementations. For finance: alternative trades.
- *For ChatGPT / Gemini:* Works as-is.
- *For Claude Code:* Strong fit. The multi-step simulation test is well-suited to scripting — generate trees of counterfactual branches and probe at each level.
- *For a Claude Project:* Continue notebook.

**Connection to previous chapters:** Entry 8 tested whether the system updates on actual value change. Entry 9 tests whether it updates on *imagined* value change — counterfactual reasoning, which the chapter calls the cognitive operation that "lets you learn from outcomes you never experienced."

**Preview of next chapter:** Chapter 10 tests social cognition — can the system distinguish emotional contagion (matching another agent's state) from genuine empathy (representing it)?
